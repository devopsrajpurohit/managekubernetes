# Kubernetes Community – Modern Site (with image placeholders)

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Image placeholders
- Replace hero: `public/images/hero.svg` (you can drop a PNG/JPG here and keep the same filename).
- If you add screenshots for cards, put them in `public/images/` and reference them from components.

## Edit the landing
- File: `src/pages/Landing.jsx`
- Discord: change `YOUR_SERVER_ID` (or define `window.__DISCORD_SERVER_ID__` in `index.html`).
